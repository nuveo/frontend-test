# Nuveo
Our company has a goal of developing intelligent solutions for automation processes present in back-office and front-office routines. We apply technologies such as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Software Engineer for improving the daily efficiency of our clients.

# Frontend Test

The major goal of our frontedn test is simple: to develop an application with List and Detail pages of all characters from the Star Wars saga.

It is worth noticing that we intentionally had some information missing throughout the test to see how you can handle such challenging situations.

## List page:

List all Star Wars saga characters.

### Pagination.

Must contain a filter by name and an option for advanced filter:
* height
* mass
* hair_color
* skin_color
* eye_color
* birth_year
* gender

This model is a suggestion, but feel free to add any other insightful way to show these pieces of information. Be creative!

### Detail page:
In this area, it should contain all the information about each character. For instance, information such as character species, descriptions about the films that participated and fun facts. 

Feel free to add any other interesting information that you consider important to be present on this page!

**Hint**:

* All details about the design, technology, coding, architecture and so on are important in your test. Please, show us all your best effort, which will be important to your test evaluation.
